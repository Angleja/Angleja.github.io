> 先说背景，看到阮一峰的Blog 386期《不要这样管理软件团队》，这其实是关乎大多数人的重要话题。也工作了一段时间了，对一些观点深有体会，无论工作是被人领导或者领导别人都很重要，特意摘抄在这里，后面有想法也会再补充。

>5 Things Managers Do That Leaders Never Would, According to Simon.[Here](https://simonsinek.com/stories/5-things-managers-do-that-leaders-never-would-according-to-simon/)

## 1. Managers Hoard Information. Leaders Overshare.
We’ve all worked for that manager who treats information like classified intelligence. They keep key details close to the vest, thinking it gives them power or control. It’s like they’re running a secret club, and you’re not on the guest list.

Simon puts it this way: “A classic manager move: keep key details close to the vest, thinking it gives them power or control… Leaders? They go the opposite way. They’ll walk into a meeting and say, ‘Here’s everything I know, here’s what I don’t, and here’s what keeps me up at night.’ Why? Because trust is built on transparency, not secrecy.”

The contrast is striking. A manager might send out a vague email about a “change in direction” but won’t explain why. A leader calls the team together, lays out the business challenge, and says, “I want your ideas. Here’s what’s at stake.”

Simon’s advice? “Next time you’re tempted to hold back info, ask yourself, ‘What’s the worst that happens if I share this? What’s the best?'”

## 2. Managers Weaponize Policy. Leaders Bend Rules for People.
Every organization has rules, but how we use them reveals everything about our leadership philosophy. Managers quote the handbook word for word, using policy as a shield to avoid difficult decisions or uncomfortable conversations.

Leaders see it differently. As Simon observes: “Leaders see policies as guardrails, not handcuffs. If someone’s struggling, a leader asks, ‘How can I help you succeed—even if it means flexing the rules?'”

The practical difference is profound. When someone hits a wall, a manager says, “Sorry, you missed the PTO deadline. Nothing I can do.” A leader responds, “You’ve had a rough month. Let’s see if we can make this time off work. I’ll talk to HR with you.”

Simon’s challenge to managers: “When someone hits a wall, don’t just say ‘that’s policy.’ Ask, ‘What’s really going on here, and how can we solve it together?'”

## 3. Managers “Fire Fast.” Leaders Coach, Then Help People Land Softly.
The business world loves the mantra “hire slow, fire fast,” but Simon has observed a crucial distinction in how managers versus leaders handle departures.

“Managers love the ‘hire slow, fire fast’ mantra,” Simon says. “But leaders know that letting someone go isn’t about making an example—it’s about dignity. I’ve seen leaders spend weeks helping someone find a better fit, even making calls to other companies. They don’t destroy confidence on the way out; they build a bridge to what’s next.”

A manager might say, “You’re not meeting expectations. Today’s your last day.” A leader takes a different approach: “I’ve noticed you’re struggling. Let’s talk about what’s not working. If this isn’t the right fit, I’ll help you find something that is—even if it’s not here.”

Simon’s reframe for anyone facing this situation: “If you have to let someone go, ask, ‘How can I help you find a place where you’ll thrive, even if it’s not here?'”

## 4. Managers Avoid Hard Conversations. Leaders Run Toward Them.
Perhaps nothing separates managers from leaders more clearly than their relationship with difficult conversations. Managers might sugarcoat, dodge, or hide behind email to avoid discomfort. Leaders understand that avoidance only makes things worse.

Simon’s observation: “Leaders pull people aside and say, ‘This is tough, but I care about you, so let’s talk.’ They know candor is kindness, not cruelty.”

In practice, this looks like a manager noticing tension between team members but saying nothing, hoping it’ll blow over. A leader sits down with both people and says, “This is awkward, but we need to talk about what’s going on. I care about both of you.”

Simon’s practical advice: “Next time you want to avoid a hard talk, say out loud, ‘This is going to be uncomfortable, but it matters.’ Then do it anyway.”

## 5. Managers Reward Compliance. Leaders Reward Dissent.
Managers love yes-men and yes-women—people who nod along and follow orders without question. Leaders actively seek out the people who will challenge them.

As Simon explains: “Managers love a good yes-man. Leaders? They want the person who says, ‘I think we’re making a mistake.’ Because that’s how you get better.”

The behavior difference is clear: a manager praises the person who always agrees in meetings. A leader publicly thanks the person who says, “I think we’re missing something,” and asks them to elaborate.

Simon once shared a story about a leader who sent a handwritten note to someone who challenged them in a meeting, saying, “Thank you for making us better.” That’s not just surprising. It’s unforgettable.

His advice: “When someone challenges you, say, ‘Thank you. Tell me more.’ Even if it stings.”

The beautiful thing about leadership is that it’s not about your job title or where you sit on the org chart. It’s about the daily choice to see people as humans rather than resources, to build trust rather than demand compliance, and to create an environment where people can do their best work.

Every interaction is an opportunity to lead. The question isn’t whether you have the authority—the question is whether you have the courage.

>作者说，下面这些做法都属于低级管理，是经理人级别（manager），最好提升到领导者级别（leader）的高级管理。[Here](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2025/10/weekly-issue-368.html)

## 1. 发生事故时，严厉追责，惩罚员工

假如项目出现问题，客户怒不可遏，团队充满矛盾，这时低级管理的经理人立即开始追责，召开紧急会议，要"查明真相"，还会发送一封口吻严厉、措辞简洁的电子邮件，阐明"员工责任和公司期望"。

真正的领导者则会召集团队，跟大家说："现在很困难，但不是互相责怪的时候，而要同舟共济，我们一起想办法解决这个问题。"

## 2. 囤积信息

很多经理把信息当成机密情报，把关键细节藏得严严实实，以为这样就能赋予他们权力或控制权。给人的感觉是他们在管理一个秘密俱乐部，而你不在成员名单上。

真正的领导者恰恰相反，他们直接告诉大家，什么事我知道，什么事我不知道，什么事我在乎。因为他知道，信任建立在透明之上，而不是保密之上。

## 3. 政策武器化

低级管理的管理者会逐字逐句地引用手册，将政策作为挡箭牌，避免艰难的决策或令人不快的对话。

真正的领导者将政策视为保护人的护栏，而不是束缚人的手铐，一旦有必要，可以为人改变规则。如果团队成员遇到困难，他会当面询问："我怎样才能帮到你，即使这意味着要打破规定？"

## 4. 快速解雇员工

低级管理的管理者喜欢"慢慢招人，快速解雇"。他可能会对你说："你没有达到预期。今天是你最后一天了。"他的目的是杀鸡儆猴。

真正的领导者不会在员工离职时摧毁他们的信心，而是帮助他们搭建通往未来生活的桥梁。他会说："我注意到你工作很艰难，我们来谈谈哪些方面出了问题。如果这里不合适你，我们看看怎么帮助你在其他地方上岗。"

## 5. 回避艰难对话

一位经理注意到两位团队成员的关系紧张，但却什么也没说，心里希望事情能尽快过去。遇到困难的谈话，他会粉饰、回避或躲在电子邮件后面，以避免尴尬。

真正的领导者会积极应对，和双方一起坐下来，说："你们发生了什么，我们谈谈吧。"他明白，回避只会让事情变得更糟。艰难的谈话虽然会让人不舒服，但无论如何还是需要去做。

## 6. 奖励服从者

低级管理的管理者喜欢唯唯诺诺的人----那些点头称是、毫无异议地服从命令的人。他们表扬那些在会议上总是附和的人。

真正的领导者会积极寻找那些敢于挑战自己的人。他们想要那种能说"我觉得我们犯了一个错误"并详细说明理由的人，因为这样才能进步。

## 7. 总结

管理团队的关键是领导力，这跟你的头衔和位置无关，只跟你每天的心态和选择有关系。

你将员工视为人而非消耗品，与他们建立信任而非命令他们服从，创造一个让别人能够发挥最佳工作效率的环境，那么你就是领导者。
 
真正的领导者将每一次与他人的互动，都看作一次引领团队的机会。问题不在于你是否有权威，而在于你是否有勇气，站出来引领团队向正确的方向前进。
